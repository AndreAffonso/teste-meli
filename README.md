# Test Mercado Libre

This Repository contains a challenge proposed by the recruiting team from [Mercado Libre](https://mercadolibre.com). Feel Free to clone it and use as you wish.

- The server-side structure was bootstrapped with [Real World App](https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app).

- The client-side project was bootstrapped with [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate).

Other great react boilerplates that inspired me:

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [React 5 layer](https://github.com/mjnr/react-5-layer-architecture)
- [Entria Full Stack](https://github.com/entria/entria-fullstack/tree/master/packages)

## Requirements

- node `v8.10` or above installed
- npm `v5` or above installed

## Getting Started

After confirming that your development environment meets the specified requirements you can run the project by doing the following:

```bash
$ npm run setup    # Install project dependencies and start the server at localhost:8081 and the client  at localhost:3000
```

## Next Steps

In This project is missing unity, integration and e2d tests. I hope implement it soon, as well a better node/express implementation.
